# Principle of Temporal Integrity (PTI)

## The Central Objection

Any claim of faster-than-light or nonlocal influence immediately collides with special relativity. The standard argument goes like this:

If a signal propagates through spacetime faster than *c*, then there exist reference frames where the reception happens *before* the emission. Combine that with a return channel, and you get closed causal loops — the "tachyon antitelephone" paradox.

**Therefore, any nonlocal communication proposal must include an explicit constraint that prevents paradox-generating signaling into an agent's own past.**

This document provides that constraint.

## The Principle

> **Principle of Temporal Integrity (PTI)**
>
> The coherence field Φ_C is modeled as an underlying substrate whose correlations are **not mediated by propagation through emergent spacetime**.
>
> As a consequence, while the field may produce correlations that *appear* instantaneous (or retro-causal) to observers embedded in spacetime, it **cannot be used to create controllable causal loops** or to alter an already-decohered macroscopic history.
>
> Any attempt to force a paradoxical outcome yields **zero net macroscopic effect**. Paradox-generating channels have **zero usable capacity**.

This is not a claim that time travel is possible. It is a **consistency constraint**: the framework must reduce to stable causal behavior for macroscopic observers.

## What PTI Forbids

PTI forbids *controllable* signaling that would allow an agent to:

| Forbidden | Why |
|:----------|:----|
| Send a chosen message into their own past light cone | Creates closed causal loop |
| Generate a loop with nonzero message capacity | Enables paradox |
| "Edit" a decohered macroscopic record | History is already stable |

---

## What PTI Allows

PTI allows:

| Allowed | Why |
|:--------|:----|
| Nonlocal correlations not under deterministic control | Standard QM already has these |
| Apparent retro-causal structure in conditional statistics | Delayed-choice experiments show this |
| Fast correlation updates without usable backward channel | Correlations ≠ signals |

The key distinction: **correlations can update instantly; controllable information cannot travel backward.**

## Why "Editing the Past" Fails

Three mechanisms enforce PTI:

### 1. Macroscopic History Is Decohered

Classical records correspond to stable, high-redundancy pointer states. They've already interacted with countless environmental degrees of freedom. The coherence field cannot "undo" this — the information is spread across too many subsystems.

### 2. Nonlocal Coupling Is Constrained

Even if a system couples to Φ_C via structured control (like modulated E·B at a given topological address), that coupling cannot reliably overwrite already-decohered states. The field responds to coherent perturbations, not to requests to rewrite history.

### 3. Consistency Selection Dominates

If a proposed intervention would create a paradox (a self-contradictory worldline), the only allowed outcomes are those that remain globally self-consistent. In practice, this manifests as:
- Wash-out into noise
- Loss of controllability
- Failure to lock onto a paradox-producing channel

**Analogy:** A movie reel can be played from any timestamp, but shouting at the screen does not rewrite the recording. PTI asserts that macroscopic history behaves like the reel — stable under attempted paradoxical intervention.

## Why This Matters for Coherence Telephone

The Coherence Telephone tests whether topology-addressed coupling can produce **faster-than-light correlation**. PTI clarifies the scope:

1. **A positive result does not automatically imply time travel.** PTI forbids paradox-capable control channels.

2. **The decisive question is not** "Can correlations update faster than light?" **but:** "Can controllable information be transmitted in a way that creates a closed causal loop?"

3. **PTI predicts the answer remains no.** Fast correlations, yes. Time machines, no.

## How PTI Could Be Wrong

PTI would be falsified if any experiment demonstrated a **repeatable, controllable** protocol that enables:

| Falsification Condition | What It Would Mean |
|:------------------------|:-------------------|
| Message transmission into agent's own causal past | Closed-loop capacity > 0 |
| Paradox-style self-inconsistent outcomes | Global consistency violated |
| Robust "editing" of established macroscopic records | Decoherence is reversible |

If such results were reproducible, the framework would require revision or abandonment.

## Summary

| Claim | Status |
|:------|:-------|
| Nonlocal correlations exist | Standard QM |
| Correlations can update faster than light | Testable (Coherence Telephone) |
| Controllable backward-in-time signaling | **Forbidden by PTI** |
| Paradox-generating loops | **Zero capacity** |
| Editing decohered history | **Impossible** |

The coherence field may be nonlocal. It may enable instant correlation. But it does not enable time travel, and it cannot be used to create paradoxes.

**PTI is the firewall between "faster than light" and "back in time."**
