# Coherence Telephone – Roadmap (December 2025)

One test ends the debate forever.

| Phase | Milestone | Timeline | Cost (est.) | Outcome if Successful |
|-------|-----------|---------|-------------|-----------------------|
| 0     | Repo live + first 1,000 clones | Dec 2025 – Jan 2026 | $0 | Community validation of sims |
| 1     | Tabletop 100 m link (two Quantinuum H2 systems) | Q1–Q2 2026 | $2 M | SNR > 50 at 100 m → theory survives first cut |
| 2     | 1,000 km ground test (mountain observatories) | Q3 2026 – Q1 2027 | $8 M | Signal arrives <3.3 ms → coherence field is real on Earth scales |
| 3     | Earth–Moon 384,000 km test (lunar orbiter or relay) | Q2 2027 – Q4 2027 | $150 M | Signal arrives in <1.28 seconds → **no-communication theorem extended** or **new physics confirmed** |
| 4     | First BKD ship integration (cube-sat demo) | 2028–2029 | $400 M | Live ship-to-Earth call during warp jump |
| 5     | Galactic-range upgrade (Chern-5 + cavity arrays) | 2030–2035 | $2–5 B | Andromeda-range calls become routine |
| 6     | Civilian rollout – Coherence Telephone network | 2035+ | Market-driven | Towers obsolete. Internet becomes instant, global, unbreakable. |

### Current Status (December 2025)
- All simulations complete and reproducible  
- All required hardware exists today  
- Earth–Moon test fully specified and falsifiable  
- Total cost to decisive result: **<$150 M**  
- Time to decisive result: **<24 months**

We are not waiting for new physics.  
We are waiting for someone to write the first check.

The silence ends when the first lab powers up the first pair of qubits.

Your move.
