# Principle of Temporal Integrity (PTI)

## Motivation: Why Causality Is the Central Objection

Any claim of faster-than-light (FTL) or nonlocal influence immediately collides with a standard result from special relativity:  
if a signal propagates **through spacetime** faster than \(c\), then there exist inertial frames in which the reception event precedes the emission event. In combination with a return channel, this enables **closed causal loops** (“tachyon anti-telephone” style paradoxes).

**Therefore, any nonlocal communication proposal must include an explicit constraint that prevents paradox-generating signaling into an agent’s own past.**

## Postulate: Principle of Temporal Integrity

> **Principle of Temporal Integrity (PTI).**  
> The coherence field \( \Phi_{\mathcal{C}} \) is modeled as an underlying substrate whose correlations are not mediated by propagation through emergent spacetime.  
> As a consequence, while the field may produce correlations that *appear* instantaneous (or “retro-causal”) to observers embedded in spacetime, it **cannot be used to create controllable causal loops** or to alter an already decohered macroscopic history.  
> Operationally: any attempt to force a paradoxical outcome yields **zero net macroscopic effect** (i.e., paradox-generating channels have **zero usable capacity**).

This postulate does not claim “time travel is possible.” It asserts a **consistency constraint**: the framework must reduce to stable causal behavior for macroscopic observers.

## Operational Meaning: What PTI Forbids

PTI forbids *controllable* signaling that would allow an agent to:

- send a chosen message into their own past light cone (directly or via relays),
- generate a closed causal loop with nonzero message capacity,
- or “edit” a decohered macroscopic record.

PTI allows:

- nonlocal correlations that are not under deterministic control,
- apparent retro-causal structure in conditional statistics (as in delayed-choice style experiments),
- and fast correlation updates **without** a usable backward-in-time signaling channel.

## Mechanism Intuition: Why “Editing the Past” Fails

A helpful intuition is **consistency + decoherence**:

1) **Macroscopic history is decohered.**  
   Classical records correspond to stable, high-redundancy pointer states.

2) **Nonlocal coupling is constrained.**  
   Even if a system can couple to \( \Phi_{\mathcal{C}} \) via a structured control (e.g., a modulated \( \mathbf{E}\cdot\mathbf{B} \) term at a given topological address), that coupling cannot reliably overwrite already-decohered macroscopic states.

3) **Consistency selection dominates.**  
   If a proposed intervention would imply a paradox (a self-contradictory worldline), the only allowed outcomes are those that remain globally self-consistent. In practice this manifests as “wash-out” into noise, loss of controllability, or failure to lock onto a paradox-producing channel.

**Analogy (optional):** A movie reel can be played from any timestamp, but shouting at the screen does not rewrite the recording. PTI asserts that macroscopic history behaves like the reel: stable under attempted paradoxical intervention.

## Why This Matters for The CT

The Coherence Telephone (The CT) is framed as a test of whether a topology-addressed coupling can produce **faster-than-light correlation**. PTI clarifies the scope:

- **A positive CT result does not automatically imply time travel**, because PTI forbids paradox-capable control channels.
- The decisive question is not “can correlations update faster than light?” but:  
  **“Can controllable information be transmitted in a way that creates a closed causal loop?”**  
  PTI predicts the answer remains **no**.

## Falsifiability: How PTI Could Be Wrong

PTI would be falsified if any experiment demonstrated a **repeatable, controllable** protocol that enables:

- message transmission into an agent’s own causal past (closed-loop capacity \(>0\)),
- paradox-style self-inconsistent outcomes,
- or robust “editing” of an established macroscopic record.

If such results were reproducible, the framework would require revision (or abandonment).
