# Which Functional Form? The Path Forward

> After establishing the coupling mechanism via axion electrodynamics and enforcing gauge invariance, I asked myself: what is the most physically motivated functional form for this theory?

The answer is now clear.

## Two Paths, One Strategy

I've developed a two-tiered theoretical framework. One is conservative and testable today. The other is profound and speculative — the prize we're probing for.

**Path 1** gets us to the experiment.  
**Path 2** explains what we find.

## Path 1: The Minimal Gauge-Invariant Model

This is the form I use for simulations, experimental predictions, and immediate work. It's built directly on established, measured physics.

### The Core Lagrangian

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{model}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{Maxwell}} + \frac{\alpha}{2\pi} \theta(\mathbf{x}, t) \, (\mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{B}) + \mathcal{L}_{\text{coh}}(\Phi_{\mathcal{C}})$$

### The Critical Specifications

**1. Topological Sector (The Addressing)**

$$\theta(\mathbf{x}, t) = 2\pi\mathcal{C} + \delta\theta(\mathbf{x}, t)$$

The background value **2π𝒞** is fixed by the Chern number — this is the address. The fluctuation **δθ** is the signal.

**2. Gauge-Invariant Coupling (The Mechanism)**

The coherence field Φ_𝒞 couples through a function of the already gauge-invariant axion term:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = g \cdot \Phi_{\mathcal{C}}^2 \cdot (\mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{B})$$

Where **g** is a coupling constant to be determined experimentally.

This is manifestly gauge-invariant and physically clear: the coherence field **modulates the strength** of the topological magnetoelectric effect.

**3. Coherence Field Dynamics (The Carrier)**

For now, Φ_𝒞 is treated as a phenomenological scalar field with:
- A kinetic term: ℒ_coh ∝ (∂_t Φ_𝒞)²
- A potential V(Φ_𝒞) that gives it stable configurations

Its precise fundamental nature is left for discovery. That's what experiments are for.

### Why This Is The Starting Point

| Reason | Explanation |
|:-------|:------------|
| **Rooted in experiment** | The θ(E·B) term is directly measured in topological insulators |
| **Gauge-invariant by construction** | No subtle theoretical issues to defend |
| **Testable and clear** | Signal should scale with Chern number 𝒞 |
| **Explains the 100× result** | E·B directly targets the canonical coupling term |
| **Simulatable now** | I can derive equations of motion and run simulations today |

This is my working theory. Version 1.0.

## Path 2: The Dynamical Axion Framework

This is the elegant, fundamental theory I'm probing for. If the experiment succeeds, this is what we'll need to explain the result.

### The Core Idea

The coherence field **is** the dynamical axion field:

$$\Phi_{\mathcal{C}}(\mathbf{x}, t) \equiv \theta(\mathbf{x}, t)$$

### The Fundamental Lagrangian

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{fundamental}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{Maxwell}} + \frac{\alpha}{4\pi} \theta F_{\mu\nu}\tilde{F}^{\mu\nu} + \frac{1}{2\Lambda^2}(\partial_\mu \theta)(\partial^\mu \theta) - V(\theta)$$

Where the potential V(θ) has minima at θ = 2πn, enforcing the topological sectors.

### The Profound Implication

In this form, the Coherence Telephone protocol is literally **creating and modulating a coherent excitation of a topological axion field** and asking if that excitation is nonlocal.

If the answer is yes, we've discovered something fundamental about the structure of the vacuum.

### Why This Waits

Path 2 is speculative. It requires:
- Explaining why the dynamical mode is nonlocal
- Understanding how it remains pinned to topological sectors
- More theoretical development before making predictions

I don't need to solve these problems to run the experiment. I only need to solve them if the experiment *succeeds*.

## The Roadmap

```
NOW:        Use Path 1 (Minimal Model) as working standard
            ↓
DOCUMENT:   Present both frameworks clearly (this document)
            ↓
EXPERIMENT: Design test for Path 1 signatures
            (topology-specific, E·B-modulated correlations)
            ↓
IF POSITIVE: Determine if data requires promoting Path 1 → Path 2
            ↓
THEORY:     Develop full dynamical axion framework
```

## The Bottom Line

**The most physically motivated functional form is the Minimal Gauge-Invariant Model (Path 1).**

A gauge-invariant coherence field Φ_𝒞 couples to the established axion electrodynamics term θ(E·B). This is:

- Conservative
- Robust  
- Directly connected to measured physics in topological materials

It provides the perfect platform for the next step: deriving the equations of motion and refining the simulations.

## What This Means

I now have a complete, defensible theoretical stack:

| Layer | Content | Status |
|:------|:--------|:-------|
| **Addressing** | θ = 2π𝒞 (Chern sets channel) | Established physics |
| **Coupling** | E·B modulation (axion electrodynamics) | Measured in TIs |
| **Gauge invariance** | Φ_𝒞 couples through gauge-invariant E·B | Manifestly safe |
| **Functional form** | ℒ_int = g·Φ_𝒞²·(E·B) | Path 1 (conservative) |
| **Hypothesis** | Coherence field is nonlocal | To be tested |

The theory is ready. The experiment is defined. The question is clear.

## Next Steps

1. Derive the equations of motion from the Path 1 Lagrangian
2. Refine simulations with the correct functional form
3. Make quantitative predictions for the Earth-Moon test
4. Build or partner to build the hardware

---

If I'm wrong, this dies cleanly at the first null result.

If I'm right, Path 2 becomes the most important theoretical problem in physics.

Either way, the experiment is worth doing.
