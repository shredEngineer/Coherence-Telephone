Ultra-minimalist scientific diagram titled “Coherence Telephone – How It Works”.
Black background, white and electric-cyan lines.
Two circles: Earth (left) and Moon (right), 384,000 km apart.
Between them: a glowing cyan topological braid (symbolizing protected coherence field).
Earth side: logical qubit + sapphire cavity + entropy modulator (simple icons).
Moon side: identical qubit + SNSPD detector.
Arrow from Earth modulator → braid → Moon detector labeled “<1.28 s”.
