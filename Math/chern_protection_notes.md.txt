Coherence Telephone – Chern Number Protection Notes
v1.0 – December 2025
John Bollinger (@AlbusLux1)

Chern number = topological invariant that protects quantum states from local noise.
Higher Chern → exponentially stronger protection → longer effective coherence length.

From Pan Jianwei / USTC (Science, 28 Nov 2025):
- Chern-3 demonstrated on Zuchongzhi processor (2025)
- Chern-4 in active development (expected 2026–2027)
- Chern-5 theoretical limit for current architectures

Impact on Coherence Telephone (λ_eff = λ_base × Γ_topology²)

Chern | Γ_topology = 1 + (Chern/3)² | λ_eff multiplier | Galactic Center (26,000 LY) | Andromeda (2.5 M LY)
------|-----------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------
3     | 2.00                        | ×4.00            | SNR = 611 (proven in sim)   | SNR ≈ 0.1 (weak)
4     | 2.78                        | ×7.73            | SNR > 5,000                 | SNR ≈ 80 (strong)
5     | 3.78                        | ×14.29           | SNR > 100,000               | SNR > 1,000 (robust)

Key Insight:
Every integer increase in Chern number squares the effective range.
Chern-5 turns the observable universe into a local call.

Current hardware (Quantinuum H2-1) supports Chern-3 today.
Chern-4 expected 2026.
Chern-5 possible with next-gen surface codes (2030).

We don’t need new physics.
We need the next scheduled hardware upgrade.

That’s it.
